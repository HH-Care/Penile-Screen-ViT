PROJECT TITLE:
Penile-Screen-ViT ‚Äî Transformer-Based Image Classifier for Genital Pathology Detection

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project presents a deep learning model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) architecture for classifying penile-related medical images into diagnostic categories. The model is fine-tuned for identifying a range of conditions, including both sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and other non-STD genital pathologies. It is intended as a research and diagnostic aid in clinical or academic settings.

Developed using TensorFlow and the `vit-keras` package, the model includes a custom classification head specifically adapted to the domain of genital pathology. The tool enables intelligent image-based diagnosis for enhancing medical research, screening, and educational purposes.
